ugursaatci/ugursaatci is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Hello there! I'm a computer engineering student and currently interning 
at the PMO department in Alternatifbank. I take pleasure in being part of an experienced 
team that actively shares knowledge. I strive for continuous self-improvement and have a special 
focus on honing my skills in React Native. By participating in Echole 42's main training program, 
I'm deepening my knowledge in software. I created my first website at the age of 10, and my passion 
for programming has only grown since then. On my GitHub profile, I share my projects and works. 
I'm motivated by challenging tasks and value the recognition of my efforts. I'm eagerly looking forward 
to the opportunity of collaborating together!
